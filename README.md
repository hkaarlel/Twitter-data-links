# Twitter-data-links-
Heikki Kaarlela

Made for the final exercise of the course Algorithms and Data Structures in the University of Oulu, October-December 2014

The purpose of the exercise was to create a program to find out links between different Twitter tweets and users (f.ex. how many users are between chosen users, or a chosen user and a hashtag in the shortest possible connection list). The exercise also included collecting the data by using Twitter's API, but it is not included in this file.

This piece of program reads that collected json-data and saves the relevant data in data structures. It also finds the links the user asks for.
