# Twitter-data-links-
Heikki Kaarlela
Made for the final exercise of the course Algorithms and Data Structures, October-December 2014
The purpose of the exercise was to create a program to find out links between different Twitter tweets and users (f.ex. how many users are between chosen users, or a chosen user and a hashtag). The exercise also included collecting the data by using Twitter's API, but it is not included in this file. This piece of program reads that collected json-data from a txt-file.
